"Hello", he said.
It was a flowery garden.
"Hello", said the roses.
Little Prince watched them.
All of them are blowing.
"Who are you? " he asked, astonished.
"We are roses", said the roses.
Oh, my God, little prince...
He felt very unhappy.
It was reported that she was the only one of her kind in the United States.
And behold, there were five thousand of them, all of them seeds.
I'm in a garden!
"She'd be upset if she saw this".
She would cough a lot and look like she's

That's when the next thing you know:
- Hello, this is a little kid.
"Hello", said the little prince politely,
I want to go back, but I'm not a glass.

"Who are you?" said the little prince.
Jesus is a fool, a fool.

But after reflection, Ilahut said:

Don't come here, you idiot, what are you looking for?
- What about you?
"Hunting for men", said the little prince.
What does it mean to "private"?
The men, says the lerenard, have guns and
They're a little bit of a mess.
You're looking for chickens.
- What about chickens?
"No", said the little prince. "She's looking for friends".
What does it mean to "private"?
It's too much to forget, you idiot.

Creating disconnects?

Of course, you're not.

I don't need to do anything.
I don't need a demon either.
A fox is like a hundred thousand foxes.
In the case of the first stage, we will need one of the following:
You'll be the only one in the world to know me.
For the only one in the world...
"I'm starting to understand", said the little one.
Prince, there's a flower... I think it's got me...
I'm not sure.
"It is possible", says the learenard.
Earth of all kinds of decoys...
Oh, it's not on earth, little boy.

Lerenard seemed very intrigued:
On another planet?
- Yes, I did.
Ilia-hunters, what's up with that planet?
- No, I'm not.
That's interesting, and the teams?
- No, I'm not.
Nothing is perfect, he sighed.
But Lenard came back to his idea:
My life is monotonous.
Men are messing up.
Wheat, and all the men look alike.
But, in the case of domesticity, Mavie

I don't have much time. I have friends to talk to.
I'm not sure what to do.
We only know the things we learn
Look, man, men have no more time
They know everything.
But as there is no such thing as a free lunch,
I'm not a friend anymore, I'm not a man anymore.
You are a unami, make me feel better.
"What shall we do?" said the little prince.
"You must be very patient", replied the leprechaun.
You'll sit a little far away from the sun first, like this,
In the grass. I'll look at you from the corner of my eye.
The language is a source of complaints.
But every day you can sit a little longer

The next day the little prince came back.
"I wish I'd come back at the same time", says
For example, at four hours

The more time goes by, the more I'm happy.
I'll feel happy.
I'll worry, I'll find out the price of oil
But come on anytime, I'll be there.

Never at what time to dress my heart...
- What are you doing?
"What is a rite?" said the little prince.
It's also something that's been forgotten, says
That's what happens when a day is different from the next.
Other days, an hour, other hours.

So the little prince domesticated the lemonard.
When the time for departure was near:
Oh, you little shit... I'm going to cry.
"It's a little bit", said the little prince, "but you're...
I hated tomorrow, but I wanted to be a ghost

The little prince was to see the roses:

"Hello", said the little prince.
Hello, says the merchant.
It was a perfectly developed market.
They're going to have to go to the bathroom.
They don't feel like they're standing up anymore.
"Why are you selling this?" said the little prince.
It is a big savings in time, says Mr
The experts have done the calculations.
You can save 53 minutes a week.
